/**
 * IPC using signals
 *
 * Write the following program to test the parentâ€“child synchronization
 * functions in Figure 10.24. The process creates a file and writes the
 * integer 0 to the file. The process then calls fork, and the parent and
 * child alternate incrementing the counter in the file. Each time the counter
 * is incremented, print which process (parent or child) is doing the
 * increment.
 *
 *
 * NOTE:
 *
 * fflush() stream buffer BEFORE fork()!!! Otherwise there will be another
 * integer 0 written in the file.
 *
 * > hexdump tmp/data/signals/sharedfile
 * 0000000 001a 0000 0000 0000
 * 0000008
 *
 * Reason:
 *
 * The problem lies in the child's first run of incre_file() and how fseek()
 * interacts with the child's inherited, unflushed buffer.
 *
 * https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/fopen.html
 *
 * "When a file is opened with update mode ('+' in the mode argument), both
 * input and output can be performed on the associated stream. However, the
 * application shall ensure that output is not directly followed by input
 * without an intervening call to fflush() or to a file positioning function
 * (fseek(), fsetpos(), or rewind()), and input is not directly followed by
 * output without an intervening call to a file positioning function, unless
 * the input operation encounters end-of-file."
 *
 * "If the stream is writable and buffered data had not been written to the
 * underlying file, fseek() shall cause the unwritten data to be written to
 * the file and shall mark the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file for
 * update."

 * fseek(pf, 0, SEEK_SET); (== rewind(pf);)
 *
 * 1. init_file() calls fwrite() to write an integer 0. If there's no
 * fflush(), this 0 sits in the stdio user-space buffer. When fork() is
 * called, both the parent and child processes inherit an identical copy of
 * this memory, which includes this unflushed buffer containing the integer 0

 * 2. The Parent's Turn:
 * fseek(pf, 0, SEEK_SET): The parent's stream has pending output (the 0 in
 * its buffer). To fulfill the fseek request, the stdio library must flush the
 * buffer first. At this point, the kernel file offset is at 0, so the 0 is
 * written to the start of the file. The file now contains 00 00 00 00. The
 * fseek then completes, leaving the offset at 0.

 * fread(): Reads the 0 from the file. The kernel's file offset is now at
 * position 4.

 * fseek(pf, 0, SEEK_SET): Rewinds the kernel offset back to 0.

 * fwrite(): The parent increments the value to 1 and writes it into its
 * buffer.

 * fflush(): The parent's buffer (containing 1) is written to the file at
 * offset 0, overwriting the original 0.

 * Result of Parent's Turn: The file on disk contains the 4-byte integer 1.
 * The shared kernel file offset is now at position 4.

 * 3. The Child's Turn (The Critical Moment) This is where the 8-byte problem
 * occurs, just as you reasoned.

 * Child Wakes Up: The child begins its first run of incre_file(). Crucially,
 * its stdio buffer still contains the original, stale integer 0 that it
 * inherited from before the fork().

 * fseek(pf, 0, SEEK_SET): The child's stream also has pending output (the
 * stale 0). To handle the seek, the stdio library must flush this buffer
 * first. But where does it flush? It flushes to the current kernel file
 * offset, which the parent just left at position 4.

 * The Append: The child's stale 0 is written to the file starting at
 * offset 4. The file now contains the integer 1 (from the parent) followed
 * by the integer 0 (from the child's stale buffer). The file is now 8 bytes
 * long.

 * The Rest of the Function: The fseek now completes, moving the kernel offset
 * to 0. The child then fread()s the integer 1 from the start of the file,
 * increments it to 2, seeks back to 0, and fwrite()s/fflush()es the 2,
 * overwriting the 1.

 * The Final Result After the first round, the file's contents are:

 * Bytes 0-3: The integer 2
 * Bytes 4-7: The integer 0

Child exits first, its stdout buffer gets flushed first.
Parent waits for the child and exits later, stdout buffer gets flushed later.

### The content of sharedfile

00000000  1a 00 00 00                                       |....|

001a -> 26, the value is correct.
